\section{\revb{Conclusion}}
\revb{This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of FPGA acceleration for three vision domains: feature extraction, conventional deep networks, and neuromorphic computing. The results demonstrate that FPGA implementations of non-von Neumann architectures offer significant advantages in parallel processing but face resource efficiency challenges. To address this limitation, numerous sparsification and quantization methods have been proposed for conventional deep networks. Neuromorphic computing presents an alternative that is particularly energy and compute efficient when combined with event-based vision sensors. Furthermore, neuromorphic processing enables fully self-supervised solutions for vision problems.}
