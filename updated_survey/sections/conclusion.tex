\section{OUR AIM (Conclusion)}
In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis for FPGA acceleration on feature extraction, conventional deep nets and neuromorphic computing as three vision fields. The results show FPGA design on Non-voneumann architectures have a big pros in terms of parallel processing, but it lacks resource efficiency. For this purpose many sparsification and quantization methods are proposed for conventional deep nets. The other alternative would be neuromorphic computing that is quite energy and compute efficient spacially when they are accompanied by event based vision sensors. In neuromophic processing, we can also attain a completely self-supervised solution for vision problems.
